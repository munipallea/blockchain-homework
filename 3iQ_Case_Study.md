# Case Study Proposal: 3iQ Digital Asset Management

## Why is Canada an attractive blockchain destination ?

Canada amongst top 5 countries in the world with an early mover advantage in the world of blockchain. Contributing factors include:
1. Strong talent pool from world class Canadian engineering schools; several with tailored blockchain programs
2. Balanced immigration policies which have permitted talent moves amidst turmoil elsewhere including US

3. Cheap power costs relatively
4. World class infrastructure
5. Balanced and well documented regulation which has avoided the extreme swings of other countries. A brief from a respected legal firm Bennet&Jones which highlights this balanced approach based on principles of protecting investors from certain undersirable aspects of the crypto race including fraud

## What Is It

Per their website - "Founded in 2012, 3iQ is a Canadian investment fund manager focused on providing investors with exposure to digital assets, disruptive technologies and the blockchain space. 3iQ was the first Canadian investment fund manager to agree to terms and conditions with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities to manage a public bitcoin investment fund and multi-cryptoasset fund for Canadian accredited investors. Access to these new technologies can be daunting, costly, and inconvenient. 3iQ has worked through a stringent regulatory process to offer investors convenient and familiar investment products to gain exposure to digital assets."

The company is very active with regular product updates. As recently s Q4 2020 company announced 'The Bitcoin Fund' which tracks the USD price fluctuation of bitcoin; which is a pure return many Canadian investors seek

As of Q4 2020 the company has three offerings. The Ethereum fund is currently being raised and the Cryptoasset fund is visible only to Qualified Institutional Investors. Data on the flagship bitcoin derived funds are below.

|Fund Name                        |NAV ($m)   |NAV/unit now|NAV/unit inception|
|---------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
|The Bitcoin Fund (QBTC.U)        |164        | 17.28      |  9.23            | 
|Bitcoin Fund The Class A (QBTC)  |211        | 22.53      |  9.23            | 

## Why This Matters

3iQ listed the Bitcoin Fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The significance of this is best captured from a quote by the famed investors the Winklevoss twins


## Why This May be Interesting

TokenFunder is on the precipice of changing the game when it comes to providing access to digital financial markets. Not only was TokenFunder the first to be regulatory-approved by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) for its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), but also was the first to be regulatory-approved for its vision of creating a secondary marketplace for exchanging digital securities through its affiliate TokenGX. TokenFunder could potentially create a vast, secure, and regulatory compliant ecosystem for private companies to raise capital as well as allowing investors to trade digital securities of these private companies. Thus, TokenFunder could become a big name player in the Canadian digital finance space.
#### "“Now, any investor can get exposure to bitcoin on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the same way they can buy an ETF to get exposure to oil, gold, or a basket of tech stocks. While exciting, it’s not unexpected; this mirrors the growing appetite that institutional and retail investors alike are demonstrating for incorporating crypto assets into their larger portfolios,” said Cameron Winklevoss."
This is a game changer as now institutional investors which may not have had a direct ability to hold crypto assets can now do so under a TSX listed and ribustrly regulated vehicle.

## Is it a game changer?

The 3iQ product space should not be looked at sheerly through a NAV lens only; as that does not do justice to the product as AuMs still are significantly lower than other closed end entities. The key is that they 'got it done'. It has been reported that the negotiation process with the Ontario Securities Commission lasted more that three years. It was also interesting to note the corporate partnerships this start-up has established which highlight the future potential of the space

## What to watch for ?
1. Will 3iQ develop scale to survive?
2. Is 'first mover' really an advantage ?
3. How will perception of crypto change in the US under a new administration ?
4. Will there be any headline / cyber risk type events that can impact public confidence ?
